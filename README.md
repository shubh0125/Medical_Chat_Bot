Medical Chat Bot 

In the era of Covid-19, where we are forced to be shut in, the trust of common folk has 
depleted in the old system of visiting doctors for diagnosis and advice. The tedious task of 
stepping into hospitals which can potentially infect people is ever so present and hence 
precautionary diagnosis becomes a very important activity. Chat bots appear to be the most 
efficient rescue for the public who is afraid to go outside, often acting as a medium to aid 
them with proper diagnosis, doctor recommendations, and hospital routes. Chat bots are
basically a computer program which engages in dialogue with the user and provides 
responses and information based on a dataset. It assists individuals within applications, 
websites or even on messaging platforms like telegram.
Chatbots are already being used across different sectors from retail, banking to online 
shopping. The Chatbot market is expected to reach a 1.25 billion dollar by the year 2025. The 
main reason for this growth has been the ease of development of such programs due to 
progress in the field of AI and Machine Learning and the concept of NLP or Natural 
Processing Language.

The Project aims to address the issue of having to go to a clinic in order to get a diagnosis of 
any sort, and give users the ease of determining the severity from their homes. This will also 
prevent unnecessary interactions during times like this and alleviate some pressure from 
hospitals and clinics and allow them to tend to the extremely severe cases. The medical bot or 
Med-Bot is meant to supplement the health care system and not replace it.
Med-Bot is a virtual medical assistant or we can simply a chatbot which analyze Customer’s
symptoms and predict the ailments.
It is an intelligent system which learns and implements various questions to the patient along 
the way as it gains experience. Our Med bot promises to cater the needs of those who don’t 
have time for themselves in the age of ‘work from home’.
In this, user would be chatting with our artificial intelligent medical assistant Med-Bot
implemented using a machine learning model and will explain about their issues through 
which Med-Bot will try to find out the cure by looking up in our databases. Cures can include 
medicinal prescription, home remedial, real time doctor consultancy or some exercises.
